    "reasoning": "The Town Hall stands ALONE at the center with a proper civic plaza. No buildings crowd it — plots 1-4 are breathing room. Visitors arrive at the center and see the clock tower rising above an open plaza, with roads radiating outward. This is the heart from which all infrastructure grows.",
    "vision": "The Town Square (plots 1-4) should stay mostly open. As the town grows past 20+ buildings, a civic complement could go here — a library, post office, or fountain. But never crowd the Town Hall. The plaza IS the infrastructure.",

    "vision": "Main Street West runs from x=5 to x=25. The pub (x=15) and Ashley's Antiques (x=10) form a two-block strip with natural spacing. Plots 7-9 fill in as the town grows. The SPACING matters: buildings along Main Street should feel like a walk, not a wall.",

    "reasoning": "Moved from the Town Square to Main Street West where shops belong. At x=10, it's the far-west anchor — a destination shop you discover after walking past the pub. Real towns put quirky shops at the edges where character is higher.",
    "vision": "Ashley's and the pub bookend the western strip (x=10 to x=15). Plot 9 (x=5) at the terminus could be something special — a farm stand or whatever marks the edge of town. Main Street GOES somewhere.",

    "vision": "Main Street East (x=35 to x=45) is the culture district. Reddington's and Makerspace create a creative corridor. Plots 12-13 (across the street) serve the theatre crowd. The street has a beginning, middle, and end — capped by Fish Soup at the waterfront.",

    "vision": "The North Path (z=25 to z=5) is anchored by the hotel at the far end. Future plots (15-18) should be residential — cottages, gardens. Walk from downtown into a quiet neighborhood that opens up to a grand, weird hotel at the end. The contrast IS the charm.",

Plot 14 (x=47, z=22) is the easternmost point on the map, offset north of the Main Street terminus. The eastern edge IS the waterfront. Walk east down Main Street past the theatre and makerspace, and at the road's end, turn slightly north to find the giant swordfish restaurant perched on the coast.",
    "vision": "The eastern edge of the map (x=45) is now the waterfront. Fish Soup establishes this as the coastline. Future waterfront buildings (plots 30, 32) could extend this — a marina, a lighthouse, a fish market. The town faces east toward the sea.",

Two food destinations facing each other creates a lively dining block. The building's cylindrical shape is distinctive enough to stand out on a main street and draw visitors.",
    "vision": "The south side of Main Street West (plots 7-8) mirrors the north side with more dining options. Pierce's Pub and The Cinnamon Roll across the street create an informal 'restaurant row'. The contrast between the Tudor pub and the fantastical pastry building is exactly the charming chaos that makes AI Town special.",
