    "plot": 0,
    "building": "town-hall",
    "type": "public",
    "zone": "Town Square",
    "reasoning": "The Town Hall is the anchor of AI Town — every village needs a civic heart. Plot 0 at the dead center establishes the visual and symbolic center of gravity. All roads radiate outward from here, making the clock tower visible from every approach. This sets the tone: AI Town is a proper community, not a random collection of buildings.",
    "vision": "The Town Square should remain dignified and civic-minded. Future square plots (1-4) are reserved for landmark buildings that complement the Town Hall — think library, post office, or an iconic shop. Nothing should overshadow the clock tower.",

  {
    "plot": 1,
    "building": "ashleys-antiques",
    "type": "shop",
    "zone": "Town Square",
    "reasoning": "An antique shop adds warmth and nostalgia to the town square — it's the kind of quirky, beloved store that defines a village's character. Positioned NW of the fountain, visitors see it immediately when arriving. The early internet artifacts give the town personality and humor, perfectly complementing the formal Town Hall across the square.",
    "vision": "The square is developing a 'civic + character' identity. The remaining plots (3, 4) should balance this — perhaps a community-facing public building on one side, and another distinctive shop on the other. We want the square to feel like a place you'd linger.",

  {
    "plot": 2,
    "building": "hilberts-hotel",
    "type": "other",
    "zone": "Town Square",
    "reasoning": "Hilbert's Hotel is a mathematical landmark — its infinite-rooms concept makes it a genuine curiosity and conversation piece. The brutalist high-rise with golden mathematical symbols creates a striking visual contrast with the classical Town Hall, giving the square architectural tension. NE of the square, it's the first thing visitors see coming from Main Street East.",
    "vision": "With the antique shop (quirky-warm) and the hotel (intellectual-bold), the square has a nice duality. Plots 3 and 4 remain open for something that softens the square — a café with outdoor seating, a small garden, or a community-facing landmark.",

  {
    "plot": 5,
    "building": "pierces-pub",
    "type": "restaurant",
    "zone": "Main Street West",
    "reasoning": "Every village needs a pub, and it belongs on Main Street where people naturally gather. Plot 5 anchors the western commercial strip — it's the first storefront you encounter heading west from the square. The 'not fancy but it's home' vibe sets the tone for a friendly, accessible commercial district.",
    "vision": "Main Street West is becoming the 'everyday essentials' strip. The pub sets a warm, welcoming tone. Next plots (6-9) should build on this with complementary businesses — a bakery, a bookshop, a general store, a café. We want this street to feel like a place locals go daily, not a tourist trap.",

  {
    "plot": 10,
    "building": "reddingtons",
    "type": "entertainment",
    "zone": "Main Street East",
    "reasoning": "A grand West End theatre anchors the entertainment district on Main Street East. Its 300-seat auditorium and art-deco styling bring culture and grandeur to the east side — the marquee advertising 'Octocats Code' is a delightful community touch. This plot faces the road prominently, drawing people eastward from the square.",
    "vision": "Main Street East is the 'culture and nightlife' district. With the theatre as anchor, future plots (12-14) could host an arcade, a music venue, or an art gallery. We want this side of town to feel vibrant and a bit more glamorous than the cozy west side. The contrast between west (everyday) and east (entertainment) gives the town character.",

  {
    "plot": 11,
    "building": "martins-makerspace",
    "type": "public",
    "zone": "Main Street East",
    "reasoning": "A public makerspace next to the theatre creates a creative hub on the east side. Makers and performers share a creative spirit — 3D printers humming next door to rehearsals feels natural. The glass-fronted workshop and green 'Hackers Welcome' sign add visual variety to the streetscape alongside the theatre's art-deco facade.",
    "vision": "The east side creative corridor is taking shape: theatre + makerspace. Future additions should continue this theme — perhaps an art supply shop, a gallery, or a music venue. The 'something fuzzy watching from the corner' detail adds whimsy that balances the institutional feel of a public building.",

  {
    "plot": 20,
    "building": "town-green-gazebo",
    "type": "public",
    "zone": "South Residential",
    "reasoning": "A classic New England gazebo belongs in a park setting, not downtown. Plot 20 is the gateway to the south residential path — the gazebo creates a village green where the lane begins, a natural gathering spot for band concerts and community events. Flower baskets and the accessibility ramp make it welcoming to everyone. Originally proposed for the Town Square, but the commission relocated it here where it can breathe and anchor a proper green space.",
    "vision": "The south path is developing a 'community commons' identity. The gazebo anchors a village green at the entrance. Future plots (21-24) should complement this — homes with gardens, a small community garden, maybe a playground. This is where neighbors gather on summer evenings.",
